Welcome to my blog!

This is my first post on sanath.dev, and I'm excited to finally have my own space on the web to share my thoughts, projects, and learnings.

## Why I'm writing

I've always believed that writing helps clarify thinking. When you're forced to explain something in words, you discover the gaps in your understanding. This blog is as much for me as it is for anyone reading — it's a place to document my journey, explore ideas, and hopefully help others along the way.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about web development, technology, and whatever else captures my interest. Some posts might be deep technical explorations, others might be quick thoughts or tips I've learned. The common thread will be authenticity — I'll write about what I'm genuinely interested in and working on.

## The tech stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) using the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme. I chose Astro because it's fast, allows me to write in Markdown, and has a minimal footprint. Perfect for a content-focused blog.

## Let's connect

If you have thoughts on anything I write, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to chat about technology, design, or potential collaborations.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more!
