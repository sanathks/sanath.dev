Hi, I'm **Sanath Samarasinghe**, a software engineer with ten years of experience building scalable systems and products.

I have been doing software engineering for the last ten years. My specialization is in Backend technologies such as Node.js with TypeScript, GraphQL, PHP, NoSQL, and AWS. But my abilities are not limited to the backend. I also have good experience in technologies such as React, Vue, and React Native.

## My Journey

Throughout my career, I have been helping companies grow their products to support millions of users. I'm a fast learner and I like to accept any challenges coming my way. That drive is what propels me forward in my career. I believe that is my true strength.
